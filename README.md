Welcome to the EPHS app! This app is specifically designed for EPHS students-
This app allows you to:
- view your existing classes and assignments
- view how much more time you have in class
- view the announcements your teachers have sent out
- have easily accessible links to school resources
- view your grades that are in schoology

Note:
There is an account login and a guest login. Your account login will be given to you once you enter the app through a link provided. You do not need to create your own login. The guest login misses out on provided assignments, grades, and announcements ; but maintains the class timer, and additional links.


EPHS app is great app that allows for a user to be able to connect to their schoology api. Once logged in, the user is able to see their completed assignments aswell as some upcoming announcements and grades. The app is design for students and also lets them view important websites like our grading portal, counselor appointment sign up, school contacts, and highschool calendar!
